I think my project build successfully but comes to an end with segmentation fault.



Now, this question has been asked already by my peers but my code is a little different. I have tried to build the Debug and Release directory and setting the flag. 
But on running this files by gdb it just says reading an OSM.map files data. 

It really is hard to debug program with print statements in all the function and how I am supposed to j=know which function has pointer out of bound. I am uploading my github repo and the code error. Can you help me with this?

How can I solve this issue?
